# PromptRepo
This GitHub repository is where you can find a prompt you need for a LLM. A LLM is an AI that generates and outputs text (it does a lot more than that as well)! Using a prompt can help guide the LLM to fit and match your needs.

## Personality Prompts
A Personality prompt is setting and telling the LLM what it should act as. Then the LLM will respond with some text acknowleding what it is. These are extremely useful when trying to set up a more detailed description of the models task you are going to provide.
